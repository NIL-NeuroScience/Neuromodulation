% Performs band-pass filtering.
% 
% INPUTS: f_bpf(sig, fr, fs, dim)
%   sig: signal
%   fr: frequency window [f_low, f_high]. If f_low = 0, only performs
%       low-pass filtering. If f_high = fs/2, only performs high-pass 
%       filtering.
%   fs: sampling frequency of sig (Hz).
%   dim: dimension to perform filtering on. (default = 1)
% 
% OUTPUTS:
%   filt: filtered signal with the same size as sig.
